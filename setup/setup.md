## How to set up a Lisk node on the network
Each subcategory offers a specific guide for each distribution of Lisk Core. The 3 supported distributions for Lisk Core are presented below:

### Binary
The **default** way to setup Lisk Core.
The binary installation is an easy and automated way to set up Lisk Core, this includes nearly completely automated update scripts and a selection of tools to help maintain a Lisk Node in a seamless way.

### Docker
Docker adds support for additional platforms upon which to run a Lisk node, e.g. running a Lisk node inside of a Docker on Windows and connecting it via a custom Node on Lisk Hub to Lisk Core, without the need to rent an additional server.

### Source
This is made for anyone wishing to develop on the Lisk Core codebase. It also comes with an extensive test-suite, detailed in `README.md`. Installation from Source enables a developer to work on the newest codebase for Lisk Core, which might not have been tagged for a release.

# This is awesome
Really, this helps a lot of people ;)
